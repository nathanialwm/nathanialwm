Nathanial Martin

I am a computer science student and the owner of an online reselling business. 
I have interest in many technical fields, but my focus so far has been on data analysis. 
I am well-versed in Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel and Javascript. 

I also have past experience with graphic design, web development, photography, and digital art. 
My background in graphic arts allows me to create good-looking and easy to understand dashboards with several different software including: Tableau, Excel and Adobe products

Simultaneously, I'm honing my data analysis portfolio and pursuing my Bachelors degree in computer science. 
I am actively seeking entry-level roles in the industry as I progress forward.
