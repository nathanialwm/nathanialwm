I am a computer science student and the owner of an online reselling business. I have learned game development, data analytics and software development as a hobby throughout my adult life and now I am pursuing my computer science degree to turn my skills into a career.

My passion lies in game development but I enjoy all forms of programming as well as data analysis with python, SQL and excel. I have worked with moderately large practice datasets, as well as constantly analyzing data for me online retail business.

I am in my junior year and actively searching for internships within software, app, and game development as well as data analytics.
