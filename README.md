I am a computer science student and the owner of an online reselling business. I have worked in many OOP languages including: Typescript, Rust, Python, Java, C# and have also worked with SQL. I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming and especially enjoy creating tools that help other's perform or solve more efficiently, and working with algorithms.

I am actively seeking internships and full-time junior positions for gameplay engineering/tools engineering and other scripting roles.
