**Nathanial Martin**

I am a computer science student and the owner of an online reselling business. I have worked in many OOP languages including: Typescript, Python, Java, C# and have also worked with SQL. I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of programming which means my passion is in core gameplay mechanics, optimizations and dynamic programming.

I am in my junior year and actively searching for internships and part-time work within software, app, and game development as well as data analytics.

I am in the beginning stages of developing a mobile app relevant to my resale business. Here is some other work that I am proud of:
